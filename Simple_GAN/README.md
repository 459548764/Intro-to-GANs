# Simple GAN
This is a series of notebooks developed for the *Intro to GANs* workshop for **Machine Learning Tokyo (MLT)**.

- Simple_GAN_0 contains the whole code for building a simple vanilla GAN, as well instructions and comments.

- Simple_GAN_n contain the same cells but with missing parts, so that you can DIY.

  In order to be able to run the code even after applying changes to only one function the original functions are also imported.

  This way one can change a function, delete the headed underscore from the function's name and use the function for the GAN.
