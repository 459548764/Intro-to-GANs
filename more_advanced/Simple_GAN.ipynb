The discriminator has to be trained at both the real data and the generated data. when training a model, we have to give the target values, so that it can compute the declination from its target (loss) and based on this to become better throuth an optimization method. Since, as we mentioned before, high validity values indicate that the given images are real and low values indicate generated (fake) images, we want the discriminator to ideally output:\n",

Since we want the generated images to be like the real ones, we want their validity to be ideally close to one. In order to achieve this, we set the target values for the validity of the generated images to be **one**. This is a bit tricky, since when we trained the discriminator, we set the target values for the generated images to zero. The difference is that now we train the generator and thus we want the generated images to be as close to the real ones as possible. And the only way to pass it to the model is by setting the target values for the validity to be the same as those of the real images. However, we don't want the disciminator to \"think\" that the generated images are indeed real. This is why we \"froze\" the discriminator at the combined model. This way, the disciminator will not be trained to recognize the generated images as real ones, and the generator will be trained to produce images as close as possible to the real ones."
